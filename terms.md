1\. Definitions

“LuaSec,” “we,” “us,” or “our” means the operator of https://luasec.net

and related services.

“You” or “User” means any person or entity accessing or using the Service.

“Script Owner” means a user who uploads, registers, or sells a Luau script via the Service.

“Buyer” means a user who purchases or receives a script key from a Script Owner.

“Obfuscation” means the automated transformation applied by the Service to Luau source code intended to make the code harder to read or reverse-engineer.

“Whitelist / Whitelisting” refers to the process of granting specific Buyers authorization to access a Script Owner’s scripts.

“Key” means a generated token issued by the Service that enables a script to run via the LuaSec loader.

“HWID” (Hardware ID) means an identifier derived from a buyer’s device hardware to bind a Key to that device.

2\. Scope of Service

LuaSec provides tools that allow Luau script developers to:

sell or distribute scripts,

obfuscate Luau script source code,

whitelist buyers via the website or a Discord bot,

generate Keys for buyers,

provide a loader that validates Keys and HWID.

3\. User Content, Ownership & License

Script Owners retain ownership of the scripts they upload. By uploading or registering a script with LuaSec you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to store, process, obfuscate, distribute (to authorized Buyers), and otherwise use your script as necessary to provide the Service.

You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights and permissions to upload, obfuscate, sell, or distribute any script or content you submit, and that doing so will not infringe any third party’s rights.

4\. Payments & Refunds

Payments for scripts, subscriptions, or services are processed via third-party payment providers (e.g., Stripe, PayPal). Payment processing is subject to the provider’s terms.

Refunds: Refund policies are set by the Script Owner for script purchases unless LuaSec explicitly offers a different refund policy for LuaSec-hosted products. LuaSec may, at its sole discretion, refund purchases in cases of service error or fraud. Contact support to request a refund.

Taxes: You are responsible for all applicable fees and taxes associated with purchases.

5\. Prohibited Conduct

You agree not to:

Upload or distribute scripts that infringe copyright, violate privacy, defame, or violate applicable law.

Attempt to reverse-engineer, deobfuscate, or otherwise circumvent LuaSec protections.

Interfere with, attack, or attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service, its infrastructure, other accounts, or third-party systems.

Violation of these rules may result in account suspension, termination, legal action, and disclosure of information to law enforcement where required.

6\. DMCA & Copyright Policy

If you believe that content available via the Service infringes your copyright, please provide a DMCA takedown notice to our designated agent (see Contact below) containing the information required by law. We will respond according to applicable law. If you are a Script Owner and you believe someone is infringing your rights by redistributing your script, contact us and we will take enforcement steps where appropriate.
