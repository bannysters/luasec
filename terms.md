### 4. Payments & Refunds

Payments are processed via third-party providers (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) and are subject to their terms. Refund policies for script purchases are set by the Script Owner unless LuaSec explicitly offers a different policy for LuaSec-hosted products.

LuaSec may issue refunds at its discretion in cases of fraud, service error, or abuse.
